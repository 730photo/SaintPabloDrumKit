# SaintPabloDrumKit

I made a drum kit with one of my favorite musicians(Kanye West) as the theme of the drum kit.
When you press one of the keys that are displayed on the screen, you get that desired sound.
So if you're good enough, you can sound just like Kanye!

Things I learned:

- KeyBoard Events in JavaScript 
- Playing audio / audio tags 
- CSS transform property

Goals: 
- make this mobile responsive
